GridClasses_Modding

This Repo is for people who want to mod GridClasses.

If you are new start reading HowToMod.txt! It helps a lot.
After that feel free to look at Basic_Mod.py to see how a real mod is built up!

Python will be scared about the fact that Player is not defined, but my game handles it. That means that you can create a temp Player
variable, but you must delete it when the mod is ready (for testing). Else the game tries to access the Player variable, but
can't because it gets rewritten.

Things found in this repo:

README: General Information

Important for starters:
HowToMod: Full Guide on how to mod GridClasses.
Basic_Mod: This is so you get a feeling of how mods would look like.
Functions: Find all usable functions.
Structure: Find how to structure your code.

PlayerData: All the playerdata you are able to change.
AllTileIDs: All the tile IDs that are standard in GridClasses.
NTTs data: All the data of the ntt's that are built in GridClasses.
DataFromFirstArgument: All the data gotten from the first argument in a function.

Requirements:
Python 3.11

c:\Users\[your PC username]\AppData\GridClasses\Mods
If that folder doesn't exist:
Start GridClasses
If it still doesn't show up:
Create it yourself and report the issue to one of our discord mods.

In the game mods folder you MUST have a Mods.py file to declare what file you use for the mod!

Limitations:
The only limitation GridClasses Modding has is the import limitation!
You can only have the following modules imported:
random,
math,
time,
datetime,
collections,
itertools,
functools,
statistics,
json,
re,
heapq,
bisect,
copy,
cmath,
decimal,
dataclasses,
enum,
typing,
uuid,
base64

If you want more modules to be imported in the future. Ask any discord mod if that is possible. They will tell it to me and I will decide
if thats possible.

Everything is on the latest version (0.1).

Want to see how to mod earlier versions? Go to the GridClasses discord server and go to the channel #modding-info.
There will be all documents of modding my game from the earliest version!

And finally for the real programmers here:
The Mod-loader works like this:

1: The mod loader checks every function for recognized names. If the function name is recognized the mod-loader puts it in the spot it
belongs to.

2: The mod loader runs the script once in a sandboxed environment. With that it makes sure you didn't import any illegal modules.

3: The mod loader opens the file copies all data adds "From config import Player". That's the reason why the mod works even though your
text editor doesn't like that you use variables that aren't defined.

4: GridClasses uses the saved data (the file + the functions the mod loader saved) to run them on their desired time!

Now you know how GridClasses' mod loader works!
