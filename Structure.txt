How to structure your code?

Well first thing to know: Your functions may NOT be in a class, because then the game doesn't know what to do!

Alright for every different event type you create a different function.
Don't want to use all functions? That's alright, because GridClasses has a smart system that doesn't need all functions!

Next up you get all the data you need from the first argument.

Example structure:

def {Function name}(data):
  {Whatever you want this function to do}
  return {a dictionary of items}

For now that's it. I will update this in the future!
