In python you have a cool keyword called "return".

But what form do you use to return?
Well, you must use a type called a dictionary. (You can find what that is online)

Of course we are going to make use of that, but we have different types of functions.
Here is everything you need to know about what you can return.

 = Update loops (Functions that repeat once per second/frame ect.):
No returnable arguments.

 = Tile behavior change:
Returnable arguments:
 - "Check": Decides if the game may or may not execute the normal tile behavior.
 - "Move": Decides if the player moves to the chosen spot.

 = NTT updates:
No returnable arguments.

 = Load_contents:
Returnable arguments:
 - "immages": Load your images with data.res_path("path")!
  - "Tiles": Loads the tile ids you want

Summary:
Return type: dict
