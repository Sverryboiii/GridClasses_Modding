In this file I will explain how to mod my game.

WARNING: If you mod your game your account has a permanent watermark!

Changable stuff:
In game player data. (It's not possible to change data of your account!


Important:
You do NOT need any module installed, because you accept arguments in all functions!

For a quick look at all the different types of functions you can use go to Functions.txt!
After defining a function you MUST accept a argument for the data!
So you do something like this:
def MyFunction(data): # Now you accepted data as argument. You may change the name, but everything with data in my examples must be your
                      # first argument!


Step 1 (find Mods.py):
To change a tile you first need this path: C:\Users\[Your PC username]\AppData\Local\GridClasses\Mods\Mods.py
Don't see the path? Run my game once and it should automaticly create Mods.py

If found open it in a text editor (You will see a basic explanation, but you can ignore that).


Step 2 (Your first tile change):
Now that you have opened Mods.py in your text editor you can change tile behavior!
To change tile behavior you need functions writen as such:

def Tile{tile_id}(data):

Where the tile_id is the id of the tile you want to change.
Lets say you want to give the player 1 health every time they step on a grass tile and you dont want to let the grass do it's own behavior.
So now you have a clear vision of what you want.
First you get the Tile_id of grass (which is 0)
Now you should have this:

def Tile0(data):

After that you want to change the player to have 1 more health on touching grass.

So you add "Player.health += 1" to your script as such:

def Tile0(data):
  Player.health += 1

(You must have an indent in python, else it will break the game)

Next up you don't want the grass tile to behave as normal after that.
That's easily done with python's return function, so your final function will be:

def Tile0(data):          # Tell GridClasses the behavior of grass (id: 0) must change
  Player.health += 1      # Tell GridClasses to give the player +1 health
  return {"Check": False} # Tell GridClasses NOT to continue with the tile check

Now you can change all stats of the player by just making siple functions!


Step 3 (The updaters):
With this script you can do something every second or every frame!

To start this you need to define the function "Second_Updater" like this:

def Second_Updater(data):

In the updater you can yet again do whatever you want!
Now we are going to change the players x to be one lower every time! (You need to avoid putting the player too far left though!)

def Second_Updater(data): # Tell GridClasses to do something every second
  if Player.x > 0:    # Only change the player's x if it's higher than 0
    Player.x -= 1     # Tell GridClasses to lower the x position of the player by 1 (This means the player goes up (Check PlayerData.txt))

But what if you want to have something done every frame like text?
Well that is also possible! Just change the name of your function to "Frame_Updater" as such:

def Frame_Updater(data):
  # This is some higher level code. You don't have to understand this!
  text = data.font.render("This is a modded text!", True, (255, 255, 255)
  screen.blit(text, (0, 0)


Step 4 (Your first NTT change):
You can change the behavior of the NTT of your choice! (NTT = monster. doesn't matter if its passive or not)

To start you need to define the function again.
The function name is as followed: On_NTT_Update{NTT_name}

With this you can create your own script of what the enemy does every frame!

Here is an example of what you could have:

def On_NTT_Update(data):
  data.NTT.health = 100

This just tells the game to update the NTTs health to 100 every frame, so the only way to kill it is to do more that 100 damage in 1 frame
