In this file I will explain how to mod my game.

WARNING: If you mod your game your account has a permanent watermark!


Summary:
Make a function to change a tiles behavior: def Tile{tile_id}():
Tell GridClasses (not) to continue the tile behavior check: return True if You also want normal behavior, return False if you don't

Changable stuff:
In game player data. (It's not possible to change data of your account!



Step 1 (Mods.py):
To change a tile you first need this path: C:\Users\[Your PC username]\AppData\Local\GridClasses\Mods\Mods.py
Don't see the path? Run my game once and it should automaticly create Mods.py

If found open it in a text editor (You will see a basic explanation, but you can ignore that).

Step 2 (Your first tile change):
Now that you have opened Mods.py in your text editor you can change tile behavior!
To change tile behavior you need functions writen as such:

def Tile{tile_id}():

Where the tile_id is the id of the tile you want to change.
Lets say you want to give the player 1 health every time they step on a grass tile and you dont want to let the grass do it's own behavior.
So now you have a clear vision of what you want.
First you get the Tile_id of grass (which is 0)
Now you should have this:

def Tile0():

After that you want to change the player to have 1 more health on touching grass.

So you add "Player.health += 1" to your script as such:

def Tile0():
  Player.health += 1

(You must have an indent in python, else it will break the game)

Next up you don't want the grass tile to behave as normal after that.
That's easily done with python's return function, so your final function will be:

def Tile0():          # Tell GridClasses the behavior of grass (id: 0) must change
  Player.health += 1  # Tell GridClasses to give the player +1 health
  return False        # Tell GridClasses NOT to continue with the tile check

Now you can change all stats of the player by just making siple functions!


Step 3 (The second updater):
With this script you can do something every second!

To start this you need to define the function "Second_Updater" like this:

def Second_Updater():

In the updater you can yet again do whatever you want!
Now we are going to change the players x to be one lower every time! (You need to avoid putting the player too far left though!)

def Second_Updater(): # Tell GridClasses to do something every second
  if Player.x > 0:    # Only change the player's x if it's higher than 0
    Player.x -= 1     # Tell GridClasses to lower the x position of the player by 1 (This means the player goes up (Check PlayerData.txt))
