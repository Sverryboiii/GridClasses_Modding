This file will go over all the data rechieved from the first argument in a function.
Exceptions at the end!

For those who don't know what I said:

A function is something like this:
def {name}():
You accept arguments like this:
def {name}(argument):
With that knowledge lets dive into my modding system again.

In the whole file I use "data" for the first argument.

All the different thing you can get from the first argument:

 - data.Player:
With this you can access all the players data.
 - data.map_size:
You can get 2 items from this: width and height. How to get them: data.map_size[0] for width and data.map_size[1] for height
 - data.dt:
This is the delta time (miliseconds passed since last frame). You can use this for your own timers.
 - data.screen:
This is the display so you can display anything you want (GridClasses is made with pygame so you can stop searching what you need to do)!
 - data.font:
You can use this font to create text (to display text on the screen you got to go take a pygame lesson).
 - data.new_pos:
This gives a tuple of the position of the player (x, y)


Exceptions:

Load_contents:
 - data.res_path:
This function takes the path from your AppData/Local/Mod/ folder (start at Mod like such "Assets/Myasset1") and gives back a full path!

All the other data parts are not included in here!
